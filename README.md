🔹 Phase 1 (Month 1–2) – Strong Foundation
1️⃣ Python for AI (revision level)

Numpy

Pandas

Basic ML concepts (overfitting, bias, variance)

Virtual environments, packaging

👉 You already know Python, so this is fast revision.

2️⃣ Core AI/ML Basics

Supervised vs Unsupervised

Regression vs Classification

Train/test split

Basic Scikit-learn

Goal: Understand how models work internally.

🔹 Phase 2 (Month 3–4) – LLM & NLP Fundamentals
1️⃣ NLP Basics

Tokenization

Embeddings

Vector similarity

Cosine similarity

2️⃣ How LLMs Work (conceptual)

Transformers

Attention mechanism

Fine-tuning vs Prompt engineering

You don’t need deep math — understand architecture clearly.

🔹 Phase 3 (Month 5–6) – Practical GenAI Stack

This is where companies hire.

1️⃣ LLM APIs

OpenAI API

Claude / Gemini basics

Prompt engineering patterns

2️⃣ LangChain / LlamaIndex

Chains

Agents

Memory

Tool calling

3️⃣ Vector Databases

FAISS (local)

Pinecone or Weaviate (cloud concept)

RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

4️⃣ FastAPI (Yes, you need it)

For AI microservices:

Streaming responses

Async endpoints

Model serving

Since you’re backend strong, this will be easy.

🔹 Phase 4 (Month 7) – Advanced Production Concepts

RAG architecture (industry level)

Embedding pipelines

Caching (Redis)

Rate limiting

Guardrails

Prompt versioning

Cost optimization

AI system design

This differentiates you from tutorial-level devs.

🔹 Phase 5 (Month 8) – Portfolio Projects (Very Important)

Build 3 solid projects:

1️⃣ Production RAG App

Tech:

FastAPI

LangChain

OpenAI

FAISS

Redis

AWS deploy

Example:
Document QA system (upload PDFs → ask questions)

2️⃣ AI SaaS Tool

Example:

Resume analyzer

AI code reviewer

Meeting summarizer

Include:

Auth

Token usage tracking

Billing logic concept

3️⃣ AI Agent System

Example:

Research agent

Web scraping + summarizer

Tool-using autonomous agent

🔹 Optional But Powerful

HuggingFace basics

Fine-tuning (LoRA concept)

Open source LLM deployment

Docker for model services
